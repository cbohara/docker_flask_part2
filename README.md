“Big data" analysis is a hot and highly valuable skill – and this course will teach you the hottest technology in big data: Apache Spark. Employers including Amazon, EBay, NASA JPL, and Yahoo all use Spark to quickly extract meaning from massive data sets across a fault-tolerant Hadoop cluster. You'll learn those same techniques, using your own Windows system right at home. It's easier than you might think.

Learn and master the art of framing data analysis problems as Spark problems through over 15 hands-on examples, and then scale them up to run on cloud computing services in this course. You'll be learning from an ex-engineer and senior manager from Amazon and IMDb.

Learn the concepts of Spark's Resilient Distributed Datastores
Develop and run Spark jobs quickly using Python
Translate complex analysis problems into iterative or multi-stage Spark scripts
Scale up to larger data sets using Amazon's Elastic MapReduce service
Understand how Hadoop YARN distributes Spark across computing clusters
Learn about other Spark technologies, like Spark SQL, Spark Streaming, and GraphX
By the end of this course, you'll be running code that analyzes gigabytes worth of information – in the cloud – in a matter of minutes.
